The LAMB (Location-Aware Matrix Blocks) is a sparse matrix storage and
multiplication library primarily developed electronic structure codes.

Its main goal is superior scalability for sparse systems as well as
high performance in all cases.

The library is written in Fortran 2003. It is generally restricted to
a subset of the language that is widely implemented in many
compilers. Some optional parts, such as code needed to interact with
non-standard hardware, may be written in other languages.
