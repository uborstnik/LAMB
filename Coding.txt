The LAMB library is written in Fortran 2003. Many files are
automatically generated from templates.

I. File location and origin.

I.a.) Files in the src/ subdirectory can be hand-edited. They were
either written by hand or, in the case of *_types.F90 files, edited
from generated templates. These templates were manually generated from
ObjectTemplate.F90 using the tools/initTemplate.sh script and then
hand-edited.

I.b.) Files in the src/autogen directory are generated from *_X*.F90
template files. All *_types.F90 files are automatically generated by
make with sed-based substitution of the template files. The
doubleprecision is replaced with the appropriate elemental data type
(such as real, double precision, integer, â€¦). The
*.{contains,interfaces,publics,uses} files are manually generated from
the same template files using the tools/makeInterface.py Python
script. They are used to wrap the same subroutines and functions for
different elemental types into a single interface. This allows
higher-level routines to be type-agnostic.

I.c.) Files in src/touchup are also generated from *_X*.F90 template
files. They are used together with the
src/autogen/*.{contains,interfaces,publics,uses} files to implement
the interface. The generated filename is *_types.main.auto. This file
is the copied to *_types.F90 and possible hand-edited.
